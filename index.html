            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a micro-economist with research interests in public health (including vaccine hesitancy, mental health, TB, and paediatric oncology), micro-econometrics (including program evaluation using both quasi-experimental survey techniques and behavioural economics RCTs, survey design, and data collection), and development economics (including the economics of education, labour economics and social grants). I have a strong interest in AI tools in research synthesis and data analysis.</p>
